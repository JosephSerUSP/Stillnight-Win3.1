# Art and Sound

## 1. Art Style

-   **Aesthetic:** The visual style is a faithful recreation of the Windows 3.1 operating system. This includes the use of pixel art, limited color palettes, and UI elements that mimic the look and feel of early 90s software.
-   **Sprites:** All characters, enemies, and items are represented by pixel art sprites. The style should be simple, clear, and easily readable at a small scale.
-   **UI:** The user interface is a key part of the aesthetic. It should be designed to look like a classic Windows application, with elements like title bars, buttons, and scroll bars that are consistent with the Windows 3.1 style.
-   **Environment:** The dungeon environments are a mix of abstract digital landscapes and surreal interpretations of computer hardware and software.

## 2. Sound Design

-   **Music:** The soundtrack is composed of retro-style electronic music, reminiscent of the chiptune and MIDI music of the 8-bit and 16-bit eras. The music should be atmospheric and evocative, enhancing the sense of mystery and exploration.
-   **Sound Effects:** Sound effects are simple and lo-fi, in keeping with the retro aesthetic. They should provide clear and satisfying feedback for player actions, such as navigating menus, attacking in combat, or finding items.
