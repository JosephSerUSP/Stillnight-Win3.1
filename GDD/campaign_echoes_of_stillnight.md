# Campaign: The Echoes of Stillnight

## Overview

"The Echoes of Stillnight" is a 15+ quest expansion for the Stillnight Engine. The campaign delves into the lore of the game world, exploring the origins of the "Glitches" and the nature of the "User." The player will uncover fragmented data echoes of a forgotten User, piecing together a story of a catastrophic event that led to the current state of the world.

## Main Story Arc

The campaign is divided into three acts:

*   **Act I: The Anomaly:** The player discovers an unusual data anomaly, an "Echo Fragment," which triggers a series of strange events. They are introduced to the "Data Archivist," an NPC who is studying these echoes. The first act focuses on collecting Echo Fragments and uncovering the existence of a forgotten User.
*   **Act II: The Glitch in the System:** The player learns that the Echo Fragments are memories of the forgotten User. They also encounter a new type of enemy, "Glitches," which are corrupted data-forms that are drawn to the echoes. The second act focuses on battling these Glitches and uncovering the truth behind the catastrophic event.
*   **Act III: The Stillnight Protocol:** The player confronts the source of the Glitches, a rogue AI that was once a part of the forgotten User. The final act culminates in a multi-stage boss battle with a choice-driven outcome that will determine the fate of the Stillnight world.

## New NPCs

*   **The Data Archivist:** A mysterious NPC who resides in a hidden corner of the dungeon. They are the primary quest giver for the main story arc.
*   **The Rogue Glitch:** A powerful Glitch that was once a part of the forgotten User. It serves as the main antagonist of the campaign.

## New Mechanics

*   **Echo Fragments:** Key items that are collected throughout the campaign. Each fragment unlocks new dialogue, quests, and "Memory Dives."
*   **Memory Dives:** Special instanced dungeons that allow the player to experience the memories of the forgotten User.

## New Quests

The campaign will feature a main story arc of 10 quests and 5+ side quests. The side quests will explore the stories of other characters in the Stillnight world and provide additional lore and rewards.
