# Business and Marketing

## 1. Monetization Strategy

-   **Model:** The game will be a premium, one-time purchase. There will be no microtransactions, loot boxes, or other in-game purchases.
-   **Price Point:** A price point of $5 - $10 USD is recommended, in line with other indie games of a similar scope.
-   **Platforms:** The initial release will be for web browsers, distributed through platforms like itch.io. Depending on the success of the initial release, the game could be ported to other platforms like Steam.

## 2. Marketing and Promotion

-   **Target Platforms:**
    -   **Social Media:** Regular posts on Twitter, Mastodon, and other platforms popular with indie game developers and players.
    -   **Forums and Communities:** Engaging with communities on Reddit (e.g., r/indiegames, r/rpg_gamers), and other relevant forums.
    -   **itch.io:** Creating a well-designed store page with a compelling description, screenshots, and a trailer.
-   **Marketing Message:** The marketing will focus on the game's unique selling points: its distinctive retro aesthetic, deep and strategic gameplay, and its highly moddable, data-driven architecture.
-   **Promotional Materials:**
    -   **Trailer:** A short, engaging trailer that showcases the gameplay and aesthetic.
    -   **Screenshots:** High-quality screenshots that highlight the game's visual style and key features.
    -   **Press Kit:** A simple press kit with information about the game, screenshots, and contact information for press and influencers.

## 3. Risks and Mitigation

-   **Risk: Niche Audience:** The game's retro aesthetic may appeal to a niche audience, limiting its potential sales.
    -   **Mitigation:** The marketing will target this niche audience directly, focusing on communities and platforms where they are most active.
-   **Risk: Competition:** The indie game market is highly competitive.
    -   **Mitigation:** The game's unique visual style and deep gameplay will help it stand out from the competition.
-   **Risk: Limited Resources:** As a solo or small team project, resources for development and marketing are limited.
    -   **Mitigation:** The scope of the game will be kept manageable, and the marketing will focus on low-cost, grassroots efforts.

## 4. Post-Launch Support

-   **Updates:** Regular updates will be released to fix bugs, add new content (creatures, items, skills), and improve the game based on player feedback.
-   **Community Engagement:** The developer(s) will actively engage with the community, responding to feedback and fostering a positive and supportive environment.
