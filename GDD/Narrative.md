# Narrative and Setting

## 1. Story Synopsis

In a forgotten corner of the early internet, a digital world known as the "Stillnight" exists. Once a bustling hub of information and early AI life, a mysterious event known as the "Corruption" shattered it, turning its inhabitants into glitched, aggressive creatures and trapping it in a perpetual state of digital twilight. The player takes on the role of a "User," an anonymous explorer who has stumbled upon a gateway into this forgotten world. Their goal is to navigate the corrupted, dungeon-like "Sectors" of the Stillnight, either to find a way to escape, to uncover the source of the Corruption, or to restore the world to its former glory.

## 2. Setting

-   **The Stillnight:** A digital world styled after a retro operating system, specifically Windows 3.1. The environment is a mix of digital and surreal landscapes, with glitchy artifacts, forgotten data streams, and corrupted file systems.
-   **The Dungeon:** The game takes place within the "Sectors," which are the game's dungeons. Each Sector is a procedurally generated floor, representing a different part of the corrupted digital world (e.g., a forgotten image library, a corrupted application, a defunct chat room).

## 3. Characters

-   **The User (Player):** A silent protagonist, whose motivations are left for the player to decide. They are an explorer, a hacker, a digital archaeologist, or simply someone who is lost.
-   **Creatures:** The inhabitants of the Stillnight. They are a mix of corrupted data, remnants of old programs, and digital lifeforms. Some are aggressive, while others can be reasoned with and recruited to the player's party.
-   **NPCs:** The player may encounter other entities within the Stillnight, such as fragmented AI, other trapped Users, or digital "ghosts" who provide clues, quests, and lore.

## 4. Themes

-   **Digital Decay and Nostalgia:** The game explores the idea of digital obsolescence and the beauty of forgotten technology.
-   **Exploration of the Unknown:** The Stillnight is a mysterious and dangerous world, and the player is driven by a sense of discovery.
-   **Humanity and Technology:** The game raises questions about the nature of artificial life and the relationship between humans and the digital worlds they create.

## 5. Narrative Progression

The story will unfold through a series of events and encounters within the dungeon. The player will piece together the history of the Stillnight and the cause of the Corruption by talking to NPCs, finding log files (lore items), and observing the environment. The narrative will be minimalistic and player-driven, with a focus on environmental storytelling.
