Icons are 12x12, and the iconsheet is 120x(height). Height doesn't matter. 
Icons are referred to by ID. Icon ID 12, for example, is in the second column/second row.
When drawn in an interface, icons ALWAYS drop a 2px shadow.

Icons 1-5 = RGBWK (element orbs)
Icons 11-15 = RGBWK (element orbs, but mini. To be overlapped at a diagonal offset.)
