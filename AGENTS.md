# Agent Instructions for Initiative and Rear Guard

This document outlines the intended mechanics for the "Initiative" and "Rear Guard" passives. Please adhere to these rules when modifying related game logic.

## Initiative

- **Rarity:** Initiative should be a rare trait, primarily found on agile or predatory creatures. It should not be a common passive.
- **Functionality:** Initiative provides a percentage-based chance for a party to execute a "first strike" (a sneak attack) at the beginning of a battle.
- **Contested Initiative:** When two parties with Initiative traits engage, the chance of a first strike is contested. If both parties have a 100% chance, this becomes a 50/50 roll to determine who acts first.
- **No Initiative:** If neither party has an Initiative trait, no first strike or sneak attack should occur. The battle should proceed with the standard turn order.

## Rear Guard

- **Rarity:** Rear Guard should be a comparatively common passive, often appearing as a secondary trait. It can be found on creatures that might not typically be in the back row, presenting a tactical choice for the player.
- **Functionality:** The Rear Guard passive completely negates an *enemy's* Initiative. It does not affect the player's party's own Initiative chance. If a party has a member with Rear Guard in the back row (slots 3 or 4), they cannot be subjected to an enemy's sneak attack.
