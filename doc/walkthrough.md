# Stillnight 5-Hour Playthrough Walkthrough

This walkthrough follows a single run that showcases the expanded main arc, the four town NPC questlines, and the deeper dungeon floors that now lead to the Eternal Warden.

## Hour 0–1: Settling into Stillnight
- **Town introductions**: Speak to Keeper Thane (the old man) to learn about the three sealing chains. Accepting his warning starts the **"Chains Beneath Stillnight"** quest (Stage 1).
- **NPC quests**:
  - **Alicia** asks for a vial of *Luminous Nectar* to steady herself before confronting her feelings. Accepting begins **"Alicia: Proof of Care"**.
  - **Laura** hints she could craft something meaningful if she had an undead keepsake, starting **"Laura: Hammer & Vow"**.
  - **Rian** (weaponsmith) wants materials and payment to rebuild his forge edge, starting **"Rian: Temper the Line"**.
  - **Mara** (auctioneer) wants proof you can survive the depths; she asks you to recover an *Auction Notice* from the first chains, starting **"Mara: Ledger of Whispers"**.
- **First dive**: Enter *Floor 1: Entry Hall*. Pick up the guaranteed treasure containing *Luminous Nectar* and sample early recruits. Combat here is light and lets you feel the MP-drain cadence.
- **Progress beat**: Returning to town with Nectar immediately advances Alicia to Stage 2 and yields her **Heartward Pin** accessory, establishing the emotional loop of bringing fragile hopes back to town.

## Hour 1–2: First Chain and Crossing
- **Floor 2: Chasm Crossing** introduces shrines, traps, and the **Ember Chain Altar (✶)**. Touching it advances the main quest to Stage 2; Keeper Thane remarks on the chain loosening next time you return.
- **Treasures**: The *Auction Notice* sits in a chest here—delivering it to Mara moves her to Stage 2 and unlocks a steady gold drip from her side hustles.
- **Enemies**: Imps, skeletons, and oozes now feature mixed elements. Learning to rotate formations keeps MP loss manageable.
- **Return loop**: Back in town, Rian can now take payment and an *Iron Sword* (found in Floor 2 loot) to advance to Stage 2, granting the **Ember Edge** blueprint reward (usable immediately as equipment).

## Hour 2–3: Mid-Run Arcs and Tide Chain
- **Floor 3: Rusted Choir** pushes harder melee packs. Ghouls now drop the **Gleaming Band**, letting Laura advance to Stage 2 and craft the **Etched Band** accessory.
- **Floor 4: Cryptic Vault** holds the **Tide Chain Altar (✶)**. Breaking it advances the main quest to Stage 3 and deepens the pressure: enemies start resisting single-element parties.
- **Quests converge**: Alicia’s Stage 3 triggers when you hand her a *Gleaming Band*, and she finally asks you to show Laura; their intertwined dialogues highlight the town’s emotional stakes.
- **Rian’s proof**: Defeating a **Flauros** (now common in deeper floors) auto-advances his quest to Stage 3, unlocking a sturdier **Chainbreaker Guard** reward.

## Hour 3–4: Veil Chain and Bloody Bargains
- **Floor 5: Blood Chapel** increases shrine risks and grants the *Veiled Ledger* treasure for Mara’s Stage 3. Delivering it unlocks her **Mirrorwork Cloak** reward and a new random rare pull each visit.
- **Floor 6: Veiled Archives** contains the **Veil Chain Altar (✶)**. Breaking it sets the main quest to Stage 4, removing the last seal. Expect mixed spellcasters here; defensive accessories from Laura and Alicia shine.
- **Escalation**: The Crimson Lord shows up more often; killing it auto-advances Laura’s quest to Stage 3, promising a final forge if you survive the Warden.

## Hour 4–5: Final Approach and Warden
- **Floor 7: Shattered Span** is a gauntlet with aggressive chase enemies. Shops can appear as reprieves; use Mara’s cloak and Rian’s guard to mitigate attrition.
- **Floor 8: Stillnight Core** is a single arena. The **Eternal Warden** awaits as the guaranteed boss (non-random). Winning sets the main quest to Stage 5.
- **Victory lap**: Returning to town after the Warden completes Keeper Thane’s quest (Stage 6). Laura forges the **Promise Loop** ring, Alicia finds the courage to stand beside Laura, Rian celebrates with a discount stock, and Mara’s auction table adds a permanent rare pull.

## Emotional Hooks Recap
- **Homecoming cadence**: Every chain break or key item encourages a return to town, making the hub feel alive and reactive.
- **Interwoven NPCs**: Alicia and Laura’s quests overlap through the *Gleaming Band*, while Mara and Rian reward preparation for the next descent.
- **Ratcheting stakes**: Three altar breaks telegraph the Warden’s awakening, and NPC dialog updates mirror the rising tension.
- **Reward rhythm**: Each quest advancement grants tangible gear, reinforcing that story beats directly improve survivability for the next push.
