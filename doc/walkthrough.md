# Five-Hour Veilfall Walkthrough

This walkthrough recounts a full five-hour descent through Stillnight, focusing on the main "Veilfall Descent" arc and the four intertwined town stories. It assumes a fresh run and highlights both gameplay beats and emotional hooks.

## Hour 0–1: First Breath & Promises
1. **Wake in Alencar (Town of Stillnight)**
   * Speak to **Alicia**. She shyly asks for *Luminous Petals* to brew something Laura will notice (Alicia's Bravery step 1).
   * Chat with **Laura**. She admits she lost a radiant band during an argument with Raphael (Laura's Honesty step 1).
   * Visit **Bram** in the forge. He wants ore rarer than steel to feel worthy of the Vigil (Bram's Craft step 1).
   * Trade gossip with **Mara**. She pawned an *Antique Emblem* and wants it back before debts swallow her (Mara's Masks step 1).
   * Open the **Journal** to see all arcs listed and confirm every storyline registered.

2. **Entry Hall (Floor 1)**
   * Explore until you find the **★ Luminous Cache**. Grabbing the *Luminous Petal* advances Alicia's quest (story trigger `luminous_cache`).
   * Fight a few low-level encounters while mapping the floor (Main arc step 2). Early victories hand out XP; the Summoner drains MP with each step, so plan recoveries.
   * Descend using the stairs after revealing enough of the map.

## Hour 1–2: Shards & Ores
3. **Chasm Crossing (Floor 2)**
   * Loot the **★ Nightglass Cache** to secure the *Nightglass Shard* (main arc step 3) and the **★ Chasm Ore** for Bram (Bram's Craft step 2).
   * The shard's pickup spawns log entries about its hum and pushes the journal forward.
   * Return to town via the stairs or press deeper—both work because the story is tracked by flags rather than a single session.

4. **Town Return**
   * Hand the *Nightglass Shard* to **Bram**. He tempers it into a *Warded Mold* (main arc step 4) and thanks you for the trust.
   * Give **Alicia** the *Luminous Petal*. She brews courage tonics, handing you two **HP Tonics** and promising to try honesty (Alicia step 3).
   * Offer the *Chasm Ore* to **Bram** for a balanced **Silver Blade** and gold (Bram step 3).
   * Refill supplies at the shop, then reopen the Journal to see updated objectives.

## Hour 2–3: Memory & Debt
5. **Rusted Choir (Floor 3)**
   * Secure the **★ Antique Emblem** for Mara (Mara step 2). Expect heavier enemies; use the Summoner's spells sparingly.
   * Descend after mapping most tiles to keep MP drain manageable.

6. **Town Return**
   * Give **Mara** the *Antique Emblem*. She tears up IOUs and pays you well (Mara step 3).
   * Chat with **Laura** again for encouragement before the next dive.

7. **Cryptic Vault (Floor 4)**
   * Track down the **★ Radiant Band**. This fuels both Laura's arc (step 2) and the main arc (step 5).
   * Optional: farm extra treasure/recruit events to round out the party.

8. **Town Return**
   * Return the *Radiant Band* to **Laura**. She pockets it, gives a **Light Amulet**, and promises to speak with Raphael (Laura step 3).
   * Present the band to **Laura** again via the main arc path—she crafts a *Gleaming Setting* and some gold (main arc step 6).
   * Check Bram's progress; he now waits for hotter alloy to finish his self-redemption.

## Hour 3–4: Blood-Light & Resolve
9. **Blood Chapel (Floor 5)**
   * Harvest the **★ Sunless Orchid** (Alicia step 4) while dodging shrines and traps. Enemies hit harder; rotate active members to manage MP drain.

10. **Town Return**
    * Deliver the orchid to **Alicia**. She brews a confession tonic and hands you **Sigil Ink** and gold (Alicia step 5). Her arc is now ready for its conclusion after you face the Sanctum.

11. **Stillnight Sanctum (Floor 6)**
    * Retrieve the **★ Embered Alloy** for Bram (Bram step 4) and push deeper toward the Sanctum.
    * There is no staircase here; use the Journal and recovery tiles to prepare.

12. **Town Return**
    * Provide Bram the *Embered Alloy*. He grants a fortified **Bone Plate** and extra XP (Bram step 5).
    * Ensure you carry both the *Warded Mold* and *Gleaming Setting*. Bram forges them into the **Warden Sigil** (main arc step 7). Laura can bless it for bonus XP (Laura step 4).

## Hour 4–5: Truth & Warden
13. **Veiled Heart (Floor 7)**
    * Face stronger demons and crimson lords; MP starvation is a real threat, so lean on recovery tiles and efficient skills.
    * Collect the **★ Sealed Ledger** (Mara step 4).
    * Carry the **Warden Sigil** to this depth to fulfill main arc step 8 and unlock final log entries about the Eternal Warden waking.

14. **Final Town Loop**
    * Hand **Mara** the *Sealed Ledger* to finish her arc; she rewards **Whispered Lessons** and gold.
    * Visit **Alicia**, **Laura**, and **Bram** for their final supportive lines before the final battle. The Journal now shows four complete NPC arcs and the main arc poised for the climax.

15. **Sanctum Assault**
    * Return to Floor 7 ready for the Eternal Warden. Use the forged **Warden Sigil** to justify the confrontation. Victories here represent the run's climax; even if you wipe, the journal keeps the arcs you've completed for the next descent.

## Emotional Hooks
* **Alicia's courage**: each herb you find is an excuse for her to edge toward honesty with Laura.
* **Laura's fear**: the radiant band forces her to confront whether her wedding is obligation or desire.
* **Bram's worth**: exotic metals remind him his craft matters beyond outfitting deserters.
* **Mara's debt**: relics you recover let her choose between selling secrets and protecting the town.
* **Main arc stakes**: the Warden Sigil is literally forged from the hopes of all four NPCs, tying every side story into the Sanctum gate you breach at the five-hour mark.

Stay mindful of MP drain on every step, leverage shrines for high-risk XP bursts, and keep revisiting town between floors to let the emotional beats land alongside your growing power.
