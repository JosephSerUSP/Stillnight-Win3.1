GENRE: Dungeon Crawler / Roguelite. Multiple runs with meta-progression.


Underneath the remote town of Alencar, 

The player controls a summoner - humans capable of interfacing with otherworldly creatures. 
Summoners are the few capable of delving safely into the dungeon, as they can recruit such creatures' aid. 
Summoned creatures slowly drain the summoner's MP - running out of MP is a death sentence, gravely crippling the creatures and draining their HP. Knowing when to return to town is essential.

NPCS:

Alicia: The sweetest klutz; A pink-haired doofus who lives with her best friend Laura. She is madly in love with Laura, and everyone knows it at this point. People tend to point out how Laura's relationship to Alicia seems malicious or abusive, considering Laura teases Alicia's feelings constantly yet is committed to a 7 years relationship with her soon to be husband, Raphael. 
Anxious Attachment. 
She runs the Consumables shop. 
Her quests all revolve about pleasing Laura somehow - she's desperate for her affection.
One of the quests involves Alicia joining the party - the player rescues her from the dungeon. Her equipment is locked and she can't be moved out of her slot. She can die, and, while the game won't end, this is permanent for the game.

Laura: A beautiful, tall blonde woman. She's very flirty and touchy with everyone. She loves having a good time, but is very down to earth and no-nonsense as well. Out of her many skills, she's a goldsmith - her quests sometimes reward rare accessories, and when she's in charge of Alicia's shop you can buy some unique accessories from her as well. Sometimes she's in charge of Alicia's shop - they live together part of the time. Her quests are very pragmatic - except one, that requires slaying a rare undead mob for his golden ring, which she will use to craft a wedding ring for her fiancee Raphael. 
CPTSD. 


????: Runs the Weapons and Armor shop. A stub.

Geraldo: Runs the Auction house, where one can buy rare, unidentified items.
His quests are asinine and rarely worth the trouble.

Yoshio: Another summoner. At some point during the game, the both of you fight. 


Daphne: Found on the 4th floor of the dungeon. ????


TRUE ENDING: The player needs to "beat the game" several times in order to see the game's true ending - This slowly opens up layers of meta progression which eventually allows the game's "true" ending to be beaten. "Beating the game" means getting the normal ending, where they suffer a gruesome, terrifying fate at the hands of the final boss, and watch the epilogue unfold, with some slightly different sub-scenes depending on what they did on that run and the meta progression. 



-----
out of order:
At some point, one quest will involve the player choosing a Dancer. They can pick one out of several dancers. This is a way to allow the player to express their sexuality and have it interface with the game and the NPCs somehow.


-----
Summons: 
Creatures can be found in the dungeon and recruited. They are NOT recruited randomly through battle like SMT; rahter, they usually present as unique 'U' tile NPCs that require unique demands - the simplest is Gold or Items, some may even offer to join for free. Others may demand the player to complete a quest, or more complex, obscure requirements. Some may challenge the player for a battle. Others must be RESCUED from a battle. And so forth.
