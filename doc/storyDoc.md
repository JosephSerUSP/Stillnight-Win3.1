GENRE: Dungeon Crawler / Roguelite. Multiple runs with meta-progression.


Underneath the remote town of Alencar, 

The player controls a summoner - humans capable of interfacing with otherworldly creatures. 
Summoners are the few capable of delving safely into the dungeon, as they can recruit such creatures' aid. 
Summoned creatures slowly drain the summoner's MP - running out of MP is a death sentence, gravely crippling the creatures and draining their HP. Knowing when to return to town is essential.
Having a Return Bead in hand is one such way, but they are rare.

NPCS:

Alicia: The sweetest klutz; A social butterfly. Pink-haired doofus who lives with her best friend Laura. She is madly in love with Laura, and everyone knows it at this point. People tend to point out how Laura's relationship to Alicia seems malicious or abusive, considering Laura teases Alicia's feelings constantly yet is committed to a 7 years relationship with her soon to be husband, Raphael. 
Anxious Attachment. 
She runs the Consumables shop. 
Her quests all revolve about pleasing Laura somehow - she's desperate for her affection.
One of the quests involves the player rescuing her from the dungeon - she joins as a Guest party member. She can die, and, while the game won't end, this is permanent for the game. It's not difficult for the player to avoid her death, usually, requiring some effort for them to see this play out. 

Laura: A beautiful, tall blonde woman. She's very flirty and touchy with everyone, despite being an introvert who enjoys her alone time. She loves having a good time, but is very down to earth and no-nonsense as well. Out of her many skills, she's a goldsmith - her quests sometimes reward rare accessories, and when she's in charge of Alicia's shop you can buy some unique accessories from her as well. Sometimes she's in charge of Alicia's shop - they live together part of the time. Her quests are very pragmatic - except one, that requires slaying a rare undead mob for his golden ring, which she will use to craft a wedding ring for her fiancee Raphael. 
CPTSD. 
She's often out of town with Raphael.
She's often out of town into the dungeon; She's also a Summoner, albeit not a very effective one.

????: Runs the Weapons and Armor shop. A stub.

Geraldo: Runs the Auction house, where one can buy rare, unidentified items.
His quests are asinine and rarely worth the trouble.

Yukio: Another summoner. At some point during the game, the both of you fight. 
Both a reference to the original summoner from the first Megami Tensei game, as well as the grandfather to the real life person who inspired Laura.
During one specific instance, he can join as a Guest party member. 
His summons are a special passive and aren't included in the party - they shield him from direct damage and act on his behalf. 

Daphne: First found on the 4th floor of the dungeon. ???? A stub.


TRUE ENDING: The player needs to "beat the game" several times in order to see the game's true ending - This slowly opens up layers of meta progression which eventually allows the game's "true" ending to be beaten. "Beating the game" means getting the normal ending, where they suffer a gruesome, terrifying fate at the hands of the final boss, and watch the epilogue unfold, with some slightly different sub-scenes depending on what they did on that run and the meta progression. 



---EVENTS-----

Raphael: At some point, one quest will involve the player choosing a Dancer. They can pick one out of several dancers. This is a way to allow the player to express their sexuality and have it interface with the game and the NPCs somehow - a fun, little event with little gameplay consequence.

Raphael: 
Personality: Quirky and klutzy like Alicia, but the ultimate pragmatic. A bit of a pick-me. He bosses Laura around with utmost charm. He's loyal to her. A Foil to Alicia in the sense that, while she's the ultimate sentimental and submissive, Raphael is the ultimate pragmatic and has his priorities "straight"; Both share the same happy go lucky, quirky attitude.

Usually out of town. The Very few times he visits, the nature of his relationships with Alicia and Laura is revealed. He treats Alicia with kindness but a pinch of rivalry, yet pity. He bosses Laura around and Laura gleefuly complies - Despite being bossed around like this, Laura's actually in full control of Raphael and she's well aware. 
Alicia pretends to like Raphael, and even sympathizes with him, but he easily ticks her off and she will spiral, trying her best to not let it show.

-----
Summons: 
Creatures can be found in the dungeon and recruited. They are NOT recruited randomly through battle like SMT; rahter, they usually present as unique 'U' tile NPCs that require unique demands - the simplest is Gold or Items, some may even offer to join for free. Others may demand the player to complete a quest, or more complex, obscure requirements. Some may challenge the player for a battle. Others must be RESCUED from a battle. And so forth.
