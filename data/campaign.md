# Campaign: The Glitching Corruption

## Overview

A strange corruption is spreading through the digital world of Stillnight, causing creatures to become aggressive and data streams to become unstable. The player is tasked by a mysterious "Data Broker" to investigate the source of this corruption and find a way to stop it. The campaign will take the player through a series of new and existing dungeons, introduce new characters, and culminate in a final confrontation with the source of the corruption.

## Act I: The Anomaly

3.  **Quest: The First Node:** The Data Broker analyzes the shards and discovers the location of a "corruption node" in a new, previously inaccessible part of the dungeon. The player is sent to destroy it.
4.  **Quest: The Guardian:** The corruption node is protected by a powerful, glitched-out version of a familiar creature. The player must defeat it to destroy the node.
